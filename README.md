Final project @ Nordic Coder - Front End class.

------
# Project Food blog

This project is hypothetical and is intended for the final exam of the Front-end course at [Nordic Coder](https://nordiccoder.com/).

# Description

This is pure HTML/CSS project with some simple JavaScript to support for Hamburger menu and Scroll-to-top button. The process for studying and creating is within 18 lessons.

# Personal purpose

I'm starting to invest more time to develop personal front-end skills which supports me more in working with website layout. I do help [my own blog](https://vomydung.wordpress.com/) thanks to Wordpress and hope to create one by myself soon.
